Data Structures

The following data structures have been implemented:

**list.h**: A multi-purpose Linked list implementation.  

    - Useful for creating Linked lists  
    
    - Forms a basis for stacks, queues. A wrapper is all that is required.  
    
    - Optimized code  
    

More to be added in the future.
